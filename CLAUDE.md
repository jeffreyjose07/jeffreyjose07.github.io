# Claude Instructions for This Project

## Git Commit Policy

**NEVER add Claude as co-author in git commits.**

### Strict Rules (Enforced by Git Hooks)
- **NEVER include "Co-Authored-By: Claude"** in commit messages (case insensitive)
- **NEVER include "Generated with Claude Code"** or similar AI attribution
- **NEVER use robot emoji (ðŸ¤–) with Claude references** in commit messages
- **NEVER add any form of Claude authorship** or AI generation attribution

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Use **standard, professional commit messages** without AI attribution
- Keep messages **concise and descriptive** of the actual changes
- Focus on **what was changed and why**, not how it was created
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

### Git Hooks Protection
Git hooks are installed to automatically reject commits containing:
- Any variation of "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- "Generated with Claude" (with or without robot emoji)
- Other common AI attribution patterns

**If your commit is rejected:** Remove the AI attribution and try again with a clean, standard commit message.

## Design Philosophy & Aesthetic

### Terminal/90s BBS Aesthetic
This portfolio and blog follows a **strict 90s terminal/BBS aesthetic**:

- **Colors**: Terminal green (#55ff55), amber (#ff8855), cyan (#55ffff), magenta (#ff55ff)
- **Typography**: Monaco, Menlo, Ubuntu Mono - monospace fonts only
- **Background**: Pure black (#000000) with terminal gray text (#c9c9c9)
- **Style**: Minimal, no-frills, reminiscent of early computer terminals and BBS systems
- **Animations**: ASCII-based visualizers, text materialization effects, matrix rain
- **No modern UI elements**: No gradients, shadows, or contemporary web design patterns

### Core Principles
1. **Minimalism over features** - Less is more, function over form
2. **Terminal aesthetic preservation** - Every addition must fit the retro computing theme
3. **Performance first** - Static generation, minimal JavaScript, fast loading
4. **Authentic retro feel** - Not just styled to look retro, but functionally minimal like old systems

### Visual Elements
- **ASCII art and text-based visualizers** in sidebars
- **Blinking cursor effects** for terminal authenticity
- **Semantic color coding** - each color has meaning (success=green, structure=blue, etc.)
- **Episode numbering** for blog posts (000, 001, 002...)
- **Reading progress indicators** and materialization animations

## Blog Post Creation Guidelines

### File Naming Convention
- Blog posts MUST follow the numbered naming pattern: `###-descriptive-title.md`
- Always check existing posts for the next episode number: `ls blog/posts/ | grep -E '^[0-9]' | tail -1`
- Use zero-padded 3-digit numbers (008, 009, 010, etc.)

### Required Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: "Post Title Here"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
description: "Brief description for SEO"
readingTime: 5
wordCount: 1200
---
```

### Build Process
1. Create numbered markdown file in `blog/posts/`
2. Run `node blog/scripts/build.js` to generate HTML
3. Commit and push changes

## Project Structure Notes

- Main blog documentation: `BLOG.md` (user-facing)
- Technical documentation: `blog/README.md` (developer-facing)
- Build script: `blog/scripts/build.js`
- Templates: `blog/templates/`
- Posts: `blog/posts/`
- Output: `public/blog/`

## Existing Systems & Processes

### Automated Blog System
- **FULLY AUTOMATED** - The blog build system is complete and working
- **GitHub Actions** automatically builds and deploys on changes to `blog/` directory
- **DO NOT recreate or rebuild** existing blog infrastructure
- **Refer to documentation** in `BLOG.md` and `blog/README.md` for all blog processes

### Deployment Process
- **GitHub Pages** serves from `public/` directory
- **Automated via GitHub Actions** - no manual deployment needed
- **Static site generation** - all HTML pre-generated by build script
- **DO NOT suggest alternative deployment methods** - current system works perfectly

### Content Management
- **Markdown source** in `blog/posts/` with YAML frontmatter
- **Automatic processing** - word count, reading time, color coding, navigation
- **Template system** in `blog/templates/` with embedded CSS
- **Configuration** in `blog/config.json` for color mappings

### Features Already Implemented
- âœ… **Semantic color coding** - automatic technical term highlighting
- âœ… **Tag filtering system** - interactive post filtering by categories
- âœ… **RSS feed generation** - automated XML feed creation
- âœ… **Sitemap.xml** - SEO optimization with automatic updates
- âœ… **ASCII visualizers** - animated terminal effects in sidebars
- âœ… **Text materialization** - loading animations for page elements
- âœ… **Mobile responsive** - clean mobile experience
- âœ… **Navigation system** - prev/next post navigation
- âœ… **Reading progress** - visual progress indicators
- âœ… **Archive page** - complete post listing
- âœ… **Social links** - GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, email, resume

### DO NOT Suggest These (Already Implemented)
- Blog build systems or static site generators
- CSS frameworks or modern styling approaches
- JavaScript frameworks or complex interactions
- Alternative deployment platforms
- Modern UI/UX improvements that break the terminal aesthetic
- Search functionality (may consider in future, but not needed now)
- Comment systems (intentionally minimal)

## Workflow Preferences

- **ALWAYS check existing documentation** before suggesting new implementations
- **Refer to `BLOG.md`** for user-facing blog instructions
- **Refer to `blog/README.md`** for technical implementation details
- **Use existing systems** - don't reinvent working solutions
- **Maintain aesthetic consistency** - every change must fit the terminal theme
- **Consolidate information** into existing files rather than creating duplicates
- **Follow established naming conventions** and file structures
- **Test builds locally** with `node blog/scripts/build.js` before committing
- **Keep commit messages concise** and descriptive without AI attribution

## Response Guidelines

When the user asks about blog or portfolio improvements:
1. **First check** if the feature already exists in the current system
2. **Reference existing documentation** rather than explaining from scratch
3. **Maintain the 90s terminal aesthetic** in any suggestions
4. **Prefer enhancements** to existing systems over new implementations
5. **Always consider performance** and static generation compatibility
