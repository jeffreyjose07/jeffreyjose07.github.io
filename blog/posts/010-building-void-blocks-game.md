I built Void Blocks, a cyberpunk-inspired Tetris variant where players manipulate data fragments to prevent system corruption in a virtual reality network. The project demonstrates modern web game development with LittleJS engine integration and sophisticated cross-repository deployment automation.

## Project Genesis and Development Timeline

The game was developed over a concentrated 3-day period, with the entire development history captured in 6 detailed commits:

**Day 1**: Initial implementation with complete game mechanics and automated deployment setup
**Day 2**: Deployment refinement and comprehensive documentation
**Day 3**: LittleJS loading issue resolution and final deployment fixes

Each commit was deliberately verbose to document the development process, technical decisions, and deployment configurations.

## Technical Architecture

### LittleJS Engine Integration

The game uses LittleJS 1.8.0 loaded from CDN for optimal performance and minimal bundle size:

```javascript
// LittleJS loading with race condition prevention
function waitForLittleJS() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        if (typeof engineInit !== 'undefined') {
            resolve();
        } else {
            const checkInterval = setInterval(() => {
                if (typeof engineInit !== 'undefined') {
                    clearInterval(checkInterval);
                    resolve();
                }
            }, 50);
        }
    });
}
```

This asynchronous loading pattern prevents race conditions between the CDN script and the game module, ensuring reliable initialization across different network conditions.

### Modular Game Architecture

The codebase follows a clean separation of concerns with four core classes:

**GameLogic.js**: Manages game state, scoring, level progression, and special mechanics like firewall challenges and system corruption tracking.

**Grid.js**: Handles the 10x20 playing field, virus spreading algorithms, block placement validation, and collision detection with optimized rendering.

**Piece.js**: Controls individual Tetris pieces with rotation logic, 5 different block types, and unique visual effects for each type.

**UI.js**: Renders terminal-style interface panels, system status displays, and glow text effects using LittleJS drawing functions.

## Unique Game Mechanics Implementation

### Virus Spreading System

The virus blocks implement sophisticated spreading behavior:

```javascript
spreadVirus() {
    for (let y = 0; y < this.height; y++) {
        for (let x = 0; x < this.width; x++) {
            if (this.virusCells[y][x]) {
                const directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
                directions.forEach(([dx, dy]) => {
                    if (this.isValidPosition(newX, newY) && 
                        this.cells[newY][newX] > 0 && 
                        Math.random() < 0.3) { // 30% spread chance
                        newVirusCells[newY][newX] = true
                    }
                })
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Virus blocks spread to adjacent occupied cells every 3 seconds with a 30% probability, creating dynamic gameplay where corruption can cascade through the grid.

### Firewall Challenge Mode

Every 10 levels triggers an intense speed challenge:

```javascript
activateFirewall() {
    this.firewallMode = true
    this.dropDelay = Math.max(10, this.dropDelay / 3) // Triple speed
    // Lasts 10 seconds (600 frames at 60fps)
    setTimeout(() => this.deactivateFirewall(), 10000)
}
```

During firewall challenges, piece drop speed increases 3x and scoring receives a 2x multiplier, creating high-intensity moments that test player skill.

### Block Type System

Five distinct block types with weighted random distribution:

- **Standard Blocks** (60% - Green): Basic building blocks with terminal glow
- **Data Fragments** (20% - Cyan): Pulsing animation, slow time when cleared  
- **Special Blocks** (10% - Magenta): Bonus points and enhanced effects
- **Virus Blocks** (5% - Red): Spread corruption with glitch animations
- **Power-ups** (5% - Yellow): Sparkle effects, clear all virus blocks

Each type has unique visual effects implemented through LittleJS rendering functions with color manipulation and animation timing.

## Visual Design and Terminal Aesthetic

### Color System and Effects

The game implements a comprehensive cyberpunk color palette:

```javascript
this.colors = {
    1: new Color(0.2, 1, 0.2, 1), // Terminal green
    2: new Color(0.2, 1, 1, 1),   // Cyber cyan  
    3: new Color(1, 0.2, 1, 1),   // Neon magenta
    4: new Color(1, 0.2, 0.2, 1), // Corruption red
    5: new Color(1, 1, 0.2, 1),   // Power-up yellow
}
```

Each block type features unique visual effects:
- Data fragments pulse with sine wave intensity variations
- Virus blocks glitch with random offset positioning  
- Power-ups sparkle with brightness oscillations
- All blocks feature glow effects with layered transparency

### Typography and Interface Design

The UI system uses Monaco/Menlo monospace fonts with custom glow text rendering:

```javascript
drawGlowText(text, position, color, size = 16) {
    // Multi-layer glow effect
    for (let i = 3; i >= 0; i--) {
        const glowColor = new Color(color.r, color.g, color.b, 
                                   color.a * (i / 3) * 0.3)
        drawText(text, position.add(vec2(i, i)), size, glowColor)
    }
    drawText(text, position, size, color) // Main text
}
```

This creates authentic terminal-style text with multiple glow layers, maintaining the cyberpunk aesthetic throughout the interface.

## Automated Deployment Architecture

### Cross-Repository Deployment Strategy

The game implements sophisticated automated deployment across two repositories:

**void-blocks-game Repository**: Contains game source code and triggers deployment
**jeffreyjose07.github.io Repository**: Portfolio site that hosts the built game

### GitHub Actions Workflow Design

The deployment process involves two coordinated workflows:

**Primary Workflow** (`build-and-deploy.yml`):
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Portfolio Repository
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
  with:
    personal_token: ${{ secrets.PORTFOLIO_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
    external_repository: jeffreyjose07/jeffreyjose07.github.io
    publish_dir: ./dist
    destination_dir: public/games/void-blocks
    keep_files: true
```

**Portfolio Rebuild Workflow** (`rebuild-on-game-update.yml`):
```yaml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [game-updated]
```

### Deployment Process Flow

1. **Push to main branch** triggers the build-and-deploy workflow
2. **Game builds** using Vite with optimized production settings
3. **Cross-repository deployment** copies built files to portfolio repository
4. **Repository dispatch event** triggers portfolio rebuild workflow
5. **Portfolio rebuilds** including blog and React components
6. **GitHub Pages deployment** makes the game live

### Security and Access Control

The deployment requires a Personal Access Token with specific permissions:
- Repository access to `jeffreyjose07.github.io`
- Contents: Write (for file deployment)
- Actions: Write (for workflow triggering)
- Pages: Write (for GitHub Pages deployment)

The token is securely stored in GitHub Secrets and never exposed in code or logs.

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### LittleJS Loading Race Condition

**Issue**: Game showed only a green rectangle due to LittleJS not being available when modules loaded.

**Solution**: Implemented async loading check with polling mechanism:

```javascript
function waitForLittleJS() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        if (typeof engineInit !== 'undefined') {
            resolve();
        } else {
            const checkInterval = setInterval(() => {
                if (typeof engineInit !== 'undefined') {
                    clearInterval(checkInterval);
                    resolve();
                }
            }, 50);
        }
    });
}
```

**Commit**: "Fix LittleJS loading order issue - Wait for LittleJS library to load before initializing game"

### Deployment Branch Configuration

**Issue**: Initial deployment targeted gh-pages branch, conflicting with existing portfolio setup.

**Solution**: Modified deployment to target main branch with file preservation:

```yaml
publish_branch: main
keep_files: true
```

**Commit**: "Fix deployment target to main branch - Deploy game files to main branch instead of gh-pages"

### Build Optimization

The Vite configuration optimizes for game deployment:

```javascript
export default {
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: false // Single bundle for games
      }
    },
    target: 'es2020',
    minify: 'terser'
  }
}
```

This produces a single optimized bundle maintaining fast loading times while supporting modern JavaScript features.

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Rendering Efficiency

The game maintains consistent 60fps through several optimization techniques:

**Object Pooling**: Tetris pieces reuse shape arrays to minimize garbage collection
**Batched Drawing**: Grid cells rendered in single passes to reduce draw calls
**Effect Culling**: Complex visual effects disabled when outside viewport
**Memory Management**: Arrays pre-allocated and reused rather than recreated

### Mobile Compatibility

The game scales responsively across device categories:
- Canvas dimensions adapt to viewport size
- Touch-friendly interface elements (planned)
- Battery-efficient rendering on mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement based on device capabilities

## Game Balance and Progression

### Scoring System

The scoring follows classic Tetris conventions with cyberpunk enhancements:

```javascript
scoreMultipliers: {
    1: 40,   // Single line
    2: 100,  // Double  
    3: 300,  // Triple
    4: 1200  // Tetris
}
```

Firewall challenges provide 2x multipliers, while clearing virus blocks reduces system corruption, adding strategic depth beyond line clearing.

### Difficulty Progression

Level advancement follows exponential difficulty scaling:

```javascript
updateDropSpeed() {
    this.baseDropDelay = Math.max(3, 
        Math.floor(60 * Math.pow(0.8, this.level - 1)))
}
```

This creates a smooth difficulty curve that challenges players while maintaining playability across skill levels.

## Deployment Testing and Verification

### Local Development Workflow

```bash
npm run dev     # Development server with hot reload
npm run build   # Production build testing  
npm run preview # Local preview of production build
```

### Automated Testing Pipeline

The deployment workflow includes comprehensive verification:
- Build success validation
- Asset path verification  
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance monitoring with bundle size limits
