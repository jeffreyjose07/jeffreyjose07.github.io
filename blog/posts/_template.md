Your first paragraph starts here. The first letter will be automatically styled in green. You can write naturally and the build system will automatically apply color coding to technical terms.

## section headings

Section headings (h2) will appear in blue. Use lowercase for consistency with the terminal aesthetic.

### subsection headings

Subsection headings (h3) will appear in magenta.

## text formatting

You can use standard Markdown formatting:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis  
- `inline code` will appear in yellow
- Links like [this link](https://example.com) will appear in cyan

## lists

Bullet points work normally:
- First item
- Second item with `code`
- Third item with **emphasis**

Numbered lists also work:
1. First numbered item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## code blocks

```javascript
// Code blocks will be styled with syntax highlighting
function example() {
  return "code appears in yellow background";
}
```

## automatic color coding

The system automatically applies colors to technical terms:

- React, TypeScript, JavaScript -> code color (yellow)
- Spring Boot, API, architecture -> framework color (blue)
- GitHub, Docker, testing -> success color (green)
- deployment, security, mobile -> warning color (orange)
- WebSocket, CI/CD, microservices -> tag color (magenta)
- Claude Code, portfolio, blog -> link/highlight colors

## quotes and emphasis

> Block quotes can be used for important callouts or philosophical reflections.

The build system maintains the existential, terminal aesthetic while making technical content accessible and beautiful.

## technical sections

When writing about complex topics, the auto-coloring helps readers distinguish between different types of concepts. For example:

The **React** application uses **TypeScript** for type safety, deploys via **GitHub Actions** to **GitHub Pages**, and implements **WebSocket** connections for real-time communication. The **architecture** follows **microservices** patterns with comprehensive **testing** and **CI/CD** pipelines.

Notice how each technical term gets appropriately colored based on its semantic meaning.
