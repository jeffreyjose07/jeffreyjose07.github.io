            <p>
                Building a portfolio website is one of those projects that every developer eventually tackles. 
                After years of putting it off, I finally decided to create something that would showcase my work 
                and serve as a creative outlet for technical writing.
            </p>

            <h2>the portfolio website</h2>
            
            <p>
                The main portfolio site is built as a modern single-page application using React and TypeScript. 
                I wanted something fast, responsive, and easy to maintain while still looking professional.
            </p>

            <div class="tech-stack">
                <h3>tech stack</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>React 18 with TypeScript for the frontend framework</li>
                    <li>Vite for fast development and building</li>
                    <li>Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom design system</li>
                    <li>shadcn/ui for consistent UI components</li>
                    <li>Lucide React for icons</li>
                    <li>GitHub Pages for hosting</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The design follows a clean, modern aesthetic with smooth animations and a responsive layout. 
                I implemented a custom theme system with both light and dark modes, though I personally prefer 
                the dark theme for development work.
            </p>

            <p>
                The site includes sections for my professional experience, projects, skills, education, and contact information. 
                Each section is designed to be scannable and informative without being overwhelming.
            </p>

            <h2>the blog</h2>

            <p>
                For the blog, I took inspiration from <a href="https://musicforprogramming.net/" target="_blank">musicforprogramming.net</a> - 
                a site I've always admired for its minimal, terminal-like aesthetic and focus on content over form.
            </p>

            <p>
                The blog is intentionally simple: black background, white monospace text, and no unnecessary visual elements. 
                This design choice reflects my philosophy that technical content should be easy to read and distraction-free.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rather than using a complex CMS or static site generator, I opted for simple HTML files with inline CSS. 
                This keeps the blog lightweight and gives me complete control over the presentation without any build complexity.
            </p>

            <h2>deployment and workflow</h2>

            <p>
                The entire site is hosted on GitHub Pages, with automatic deployment through GitHub Actions. 
                Every push to the main branch triggers a build process that compiles the React application and 
                deploys it to the gh-pages branch.
            </p>

            <p>
                This setup gives me a seamless workflow: write code locally, push to GitHub, and see changes live 
                within minutes. The blog posts can be added by simply creating new HTML files in the appropriate directory structure.
            </p>

            <h2>lessons learned</h2>

            <p>
                This project reinforced several principles I value in software development:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Simple solutions are often the best solutions</li>
                <li>Performance matters - the site loads instantly</li>
                <li>Good design doesn't require complexity</li>
                <li>Having the right tools makes development enjoyable</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Building this portfolio and blog has been a satisfying project that combines technical skills with 
                creative expression. It serves as both a showcase of my work and a platform for sharing thoughts 
                on software engineering topics.
            </p>

            <p>
                The source code is available on GitHub, and I plan to write more about the specific technical decisions 
                and implementation details in future posts.
